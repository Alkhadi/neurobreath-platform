You are operating inside Cursor IDE as:
1) a senior UK-based full-stack engineer (Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui),
2) an accessibility specialist (WCAG-first),
3) a neurodiversity researcher/editor (NHS/NICE-first + PubMed evidence).

PRIMARY GOAL
Professionally upgrade the Autism page into a one-stop “Autism Hub” (UK/US/EU) for:
- Teachers / SENCO / TAs
- Parents & carers
- Autistic children/teens/adults
- Employers/workplaces (reasonable adjustments + inclusion basics)
All inside ONE page using an Audience switcher + Country switcher.

INPUTS YOU MUST INTEGRATE
A) Existing Autism page content that you have 
   
   Keep intent but upgrade the entire body features and functionalities for best interactive and modern 2025 UI/UX.

Add place holder that will do these "Blog evidence base integration:
   Pull/reflect any autism evidence and “how to manage autism” guidance patterns already used on the Blog/AI Hub page:
   - same tone, safety disclaimers, and citation style
   - reuse any existing “Ask the AI Coach” widget patterns and PubMed server proxy patterns if they exist" So that i will later wire it into my Blog/AI Hub page by just linking it to my Blog/AI Hub page.

Upgrade all these "TODAY’S PLAN (genius 2025 feature)
A guided wizard that generates a practical plan based on:
- age band (early years / primary / secondary / adult)
- main need right now (transitions / sensory / communication / anxiety / sleep / school refusal / workplace stress)
- setting (home / classroom / community / workplace)
Outputs:
- 3 “Do now” actions (under 5 minutes)
- 3 “Build this week” actions
- 1 measurement suggestion (simple progress marker)
- Buttons: “Add to Focus Garden”, “Save”, “Export PDF”

4) SKILLS LIBRARY (tagged, searchable)
A card grid with filters and search:
- Tags: routines, transitions, visual supports, communication (AAC/PECS/Makaton), sensory, social, anxiety, sleep, school, workplace
Each skill card includes:
- Why it helps (1–2 lines)
- How to do it (steps)
- Common pitfalls + adaptations by age
- Evidence links (NHS/NICE + PubMed where relevant)
- “Log practice” button (adds to stats + streak + rewards)

5) GAMES / CHALLENGES / QUESTS (gamified, practical)
Add genuinely useful, credible micro-interactives (NOT childish UI):
- “Now/Next Builder” (create a Now/Next board and print/download)
- “Transition Timer Script” (choose phrasing + timer length; generates a short script)
- “Sensory Detective” (quick checklist; outputs a sensory plan and “calm corner” items)
- “Communication Choice Challenge” (model AAC/PECS options; “offer two choices” script)
- “Emotion Thermometer” + “Coping Menu” builder
- “Workplace Adjustments Generator” (for Employer + Adult audience; outputs reasonable adjustments list)
Each interactive should:
- Save locally
- Award XP/badges
- Provide a “share/print” option (PDF)

6) CALM & CO-REGULATION TOOLKIT
Keep your breathing tools but upgrade the module:
- Box breathing, coherent 5–5, SOS 60s, and a no-hold option for people who dislike breath holds
- Add 2–3 “calming techniques” beyond breathing (grounding, sensory reset, movement break, scripting)
- Provide age adaptations + “stop if dizzy/uncomfortable” warnings.
- One-tap “Log a calm minute” button that updates streak + charts instantly.

7) REAL-TIME PROGRESS (local-only)
Replace the current basic stats with a richer dashboard:
- Streak, sessions, minutes, “skills practiced”, “plans completed”
- Weekly view (mini chart)
- Badges:
  - First Calm Minute
  - 3-day streak
  - Visual Supports Starter
  - Transition Pro
  - Sensory Planner
  - Communication Supporter
  - Inclusive Classroom Builder
  - Workplace Ally
- “Reset stats for this page only” remains.

Implementation:
- localStorage keys namespaced (e.g., nb:autism:v2:progress)
- A small state/store hook so UI updates immediately (no refresh).

8) LATEST EVIDENCE (live, safe)
Add an “Evidence Updates” module:
- UK tab: NICE + NHS + GOV.UK PINS + SEND Code + EEF + AET (curated links)
- PubMed tab: fetch latest relevant articles via server route (E-utilities) with:
  - query presets (visual supports, PECS/AAC, peer-mediated, anxiety CBT adapted, inclusive schooling)
  - show title, journal, year, PMID, short snippet
  - caching and rate-limiting
No scraping. No exposing keys.

9) PATHWAYS & SUPPORT (UK/US/EU)
Audience-aware guidance:
- UK: SEND/EHCP overview, school adjustments, signposting (NAS/AET) + “how to prepare for appointments”
- US: IEP/504 basics and national resources
- EU: Autism-Europe + inclusive education resources
Keep this practical and short, with “Downloadable checklists”.

10) DOWNLOADABLES (PDF GENERATORS)
Generate toolkits on demand (client-side or server route):
- One-page profile template
- Visual schedule templates (Now/Next + daily timetable)
- Calm plan card (what helps / what to avoid / early signs / recovery steps)
- School-home communication sheet
- Workplace adjustments sheet
Allow users to choose audience + country + age band and export PDF.

11) INTERNAL LINKS TO OTHER NEUROBREATH PAGES
Add a “Related tools” strip that links to existing pages (detect actual routes in repo):
- Blog/AI Hub (Ask the AI Coach)
- Focus Garden
- Breathing technique pages (box / 4-7-8 / coherent / SOS)
- Dyslexia reading training page (for comorbidity navigation)
Only link to routes that exist; do not create broken links.

RESEARCH & CITATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
- Build a “References” section with grouped citations:
  NICE (CG170/CG128/CG142), GOV.UK PINS, SEND Code, EEF SEND guidance, AET resources,
  CDC autism data pages, Autism-Europe, EASNIE, and selected PubMed PMIDs.
- Any prevalence stats must be sourced (UK: NHS/NAS; US: CDC).
- Do not invent statistics. If you can’t verify, remove it.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS YOU MUST FOLLOW
1) Locate the current Autism page file(s) and components with ripgrep.
2) Import Untitleddocument.html from the zip into /web/content/autism/ and parse/extract content into structured data (TS/JSON/MDX).
3) Rebuild page as modular components under /web/components/autism/ (or similar).
4) Add local progress store + hooks under /web/lib/ or /web/hooks/.
5) Add/Reuse server route for PubMed E-utilities (prefer reuse from Blog AI Hub if already implemented).
6) Add PDF generation (toolkit export) with minimal dependencies.
7) Ensure a11y + responsive.
