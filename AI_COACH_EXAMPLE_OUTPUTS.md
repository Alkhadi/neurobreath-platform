#### Plain English Summary:
1. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting executive function (NICE NG87, DSM-5).
2. Core features include difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity—but presentation varies widely across individuals and settings.
3. ADHD is lifelong but often evolves; hyperactivity may lessen with age while attention challenges persist (Research: PMID 31411903).
4. Many people with ADHD have unique strengths including creativity, problem-solving under pressure, hyperfocus on interests, and entrepreneurial thinking.

#### Evidence Snapshot:

**NHS/NICE Guidance:**
- NHS and NICE provide comprehensive evidence-based guidance on this topic (5 official sources linked below)

## Example 2: Breathing for Anxiety

### User Input:
- **Context**: Adult, Workplace, Anxiety
- **Topic**: Breathing
- **Action**: Types "How can breathing help with anxiety at work?"

### AI Coach Output:

#### Title:
**Context used:** UK · Adults (25+) · Workplace · challenge: Anxiety · Topic: Breathing

#### Plain English Summary:
1. Controlled breathing techniques activate the vagus nerve and parasympathetic nervous system (Research: PMID 29616846).
2. Slow, deep breathing (4-6 breaths/min) reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones like cortisol (PMID 28974862).
3. Breathing practices are evidence-based tools for anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation with zero side effects.
4. Regular practice builds resilience, improves baseline HRV, and enhances stress recovery (Cochrane Review 2019).

#### Evidence Snapshot:

**NHS/NICE Guidance:**
- NHS and NICE provide comprehensive evidence-based guidance on this topic (3 official sources linked below)

**Research Evidence:**
- 6 peer-reviewed studies support these approaches—including systematic reviews and RCTs (PMIDs linked below)
- Slow breathing (6 breaths/min) optimizes HRV and reduces cortisol (PMID 28974862, 29616846)

**Practical Supports:**
- Box Breathing (4-4-4-4): used by military, emergency responders, and elite athletes for calm focus under pressure
- 4-7-8 Breathing: developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, acts as natural tranquilizer for the nervous system
- Coherent Breathing (5-5): rhythmic breathing at 6 breaths per minute optimizes heart rate variability (HRV)

**When to Seek Help:**
- If anxiety interferes with work, relationships, or daily activities
- Contact GP for referral to talking therapies (IAPT in England)
- Crisis: call 111 for urgent mental health support or 999 in emergency

#### Practical 7-Day Actions (Workplace):
1. **Day 1-2**: Practice Box Breathing (4-4-4-4) for 2 minutes before meetings or stressful tasks
2. **Day 3-4**: Use 4-7-8 breathing during lunch break—in for 4, hold for 7, out for 8
3. **Day 5-6**: Set hourly reminders to do 3 deep breaths (prevents anxiety buildup)
4. **Day 7**: Try 5-minute Coherent Breathing session (5 seconds in, 5 seconds out)
5. **All week**: Keep breathing cheat sheet at desk (available from NeuroBreath tools)
6. **All week**: Notice which technique works best for your anxiety triggers

## Example 3: Depression Assessment

### User Input:

### AI Coach Output:

#### Title:
**Context used:** UK · Young adults (18-25) · Home · challenge: Mood · Topic: Depression

#### Plain English Summary:
1. Clinical depression (major depressive disorder) involves persistent low mood, loss of interest, and reduced energy lasting 2+ weeks (DSM-5, ICD-11).
2. Physical symptoms include sleep changes, appetite changes, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and psychomotor changes (NICE CG90).
3. Depression is common (1 in 5 UK adults experience depression annually) and highly treatable with proper support (ONS 2023).

## Key Differences from Before

### ❌ OLD (Vague):
"ADHD can be managed with structure and routines."

### ✅ NEW (Evidence-Based):
"External structure compensates for internal executive function challenges. Use visible timers, alarms, and reminders to reduce time blindness. Break tasks into small steps with immediate rewards. Evidence shows multimodal treatment (behavioral + environmental) is most effective (MTA study PMID 10517495; Cochrane review PMID 31411903)."

---

### ❌ OLD (Generic):
"Breathing helps reduce stress."

### ✅ NEW (Specific):
"Controlled breathing activates the vagus nerve and parasympathetic nervous system (Research: PMID 29616846). Slow breathing at 6 breaths/min reduces cortisol by 30-40% and optimizes heart rate variability (PMID 28974862, 11744522). Box Breathing (4-4-4-4) is used by military and emergency responders for calm focus under pressure."

---

### ❌ OLD (Unsourced):
"CBT is helpful for depression."

### ✅ NEW (Cited):
"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is first-line treatment per NICE CG90 (2022) with large effect sizes in RCTs. Combination therapy (CBT + medication) is most effective for moderate-severe depression (STAR*D trial PMID 16551270). Behavioral activation helps by re-engaging reward pathways (Cochrane review PMID 27470975)."
