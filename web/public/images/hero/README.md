# NeuroBreath hero image

Place a single decorative hero image at:

- `web/public/images/hero/neurobreath-hero.webp`

## Export spec (recommended)

- Format: WebP
- Width: 2400px (acceptable range: 1920–2560)
- Height: ~1350px (16:9-ish) or slightly taller (e.g. 3:2) to allow safe cropping on mobile
- Quality: 70–80
- Visual direction:
  - Calm + breath + focus
  - Gentle neuro-inspired pattern (subtle, not busy)
  - Avoid faces / identifiable people
  - Avoid high-frequency detail that competes with the H1

## Crop guidance

- Keep the calmest region in the center-left (behind the H1)
- Ensure no hard edges or bright hotspots behind text

The hero component treats this as purely decorative (`alt=""`, `aria-hidden`).
