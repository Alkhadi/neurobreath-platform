Everyone experiences anxiety sometimes, but when it becomes persistent, overwhelming, or interferes with daily life, it may be an anxiety disorder.</p><p>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health condition in the UK, affecting approximately 1 in 6 adults each week. They are highly treatable with the right support.</p><h2>Types of Anxiety</h2><ul><li><strong>Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD):</strong> Persistent, excessive worry about various aspects of life</li><li><strong>Panic Disorder:</strong> Recurrent unexpected panic attacks and fear of future attacks</li><li><strong>Social Anxiety:</strong> Intense fear of social situations and being judged by others</li><li><strong>Phobias:</strong> Intense fear of specific objects or situations</li></ul><h2>Practical Anxiety Management Strategies</h2><h3>Breathing Techniques</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li><strong>4-7-8 Breathing:</strong> Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8</li><li><strong>Box Breathing:</strong> Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4</li><li><strong>Diaphragmatic breathing:</strong> Breathe deeply into your belly (not chest)</li><li>Practice daily, not just during anxiety — builds the skill</li><li>Use breathing as your 'anchor' when anxiety rises</li></ul><h3>Grounding Techniques (for panic or overwhelm)</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li><strong>5-4-3-2-1 technique:</strong> Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste</li><li><strong>Physical grounding:</strong> Press feet into floor, hold ice cube, splash cold water on face</li><li><strong>Mental grounding:</strong> Count backwards from 100 by 7s, name countries alphabetically, recite a poem</li><li><strong>Soothing grounding:</strong> Imagine a safe place, hug yourself, use a comfort object</li></ul><h3>Challenging Anxious Thoughts</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Identify the worry: 'What exactly am I afraid will happen?'</li><li>Is it likely? What's the evidence for and against?</li><li>What's the worst that could happen? Could I cope with that?</li><li>What would I tell a friend in this situation?</li><li>Reframe: 'I feel anxious' instead of 'Something bad will happen'</li></ul><h3>Worry Time</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Schedule 15-20 minutes daily as 'worry time'</li><li>When worries arise during the day, write them down for worry time</li><li>During worry time, review worries: Which need action? Which are hypothetical?</li><li>After worry time, use distraction or grounding to move on</li></ul><h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Limit caffeine and stimulants (they can trigger anxiety)</li><li>Avoid alcohol (it worsens anxiety once it wears off)</li><li>Regular exercise (20-30 minutes most days reduces anxiety)</li><li>Sleep 7-9 hours per night (fatigue worsens anxiety)</li><li>Eat regular, balanced meals (low blood sugar can mimic anxiety symptoms)</li></ul><h3>Exposure (for avoidance-based anxiety)</h3><p>Gradual, repeated exposure to feared situations reduces anxiety over time.

They peak within 10 minutes and are not dangerous.</p><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Remind yourself: 'This is a panic attack. It's uncomfortable but not dangerous. It will pass.'</li><li>Focus on slow, controlled breathing (4-7-8 or box breathing)</li><li>Stay where you are if possible (leaving reinforces avoidance)</li><li>Use grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1)</li><li>Ride the wave — don't fight it</li></ul><h2>Professional Support</h2><h3>Psychological Therapies</h3><ul><li><strong>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT):</strong> First-line treatment for anxiety disorders</li><li><strong>Exposure Therapy:</strong> For phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety</li><li><strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):</strong> Learning to accept anxious feelings rather than fighting them</li></ul><p>Access via NHS Talking Therapies (via GP), private therapist, or Anxiety UK.</p><h3>Medication</h3><p>SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) are commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders.

When outside this window:</p><ul><li><strong>Hyperarousal (above window):</strong> Anxiety, panic, anger, overwhelm → Use grounding, cold water, breathing</li><li><strong>Hypoarousal (below window):</strong> Numbness, dissociation, shutdown → Use activation, movement, sensory input</li></ul><p>The goal is to widen your window of tolerance over time through skill practice.</p><h2>Emotional Regulation for Neurodivergent Individuals</h2><h3>ADHD</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Emotional impulsivity is part of ADHD — use 'pause' strategies (count to 10, walk away)</li><li>Externalise emotions (write, draw, talk)</li><li>Use timers for cooling-off periods</li><li>Build in movement breaks to manage restlessness</li></ul><h3>Autism</h3><ul class='practical-checklist'><li>Use visual supports (emotion thermometer, Zones of Regulation chart)</li><li>Create a sensory toolkit for regulation (fidgets, weighted items, music)</li><li>Identify and avoid overwhelming sensory triggers</li><li>Allow time for emotional processing — autistic individuals may need longer to recover</li></ul><h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2><p><strong>Contact your GP or therapist if:</strong></p><ul><li>Emotional dysregulation is affecting daily life, work, or relationships</li><li>You're engaging in harmful coping behaviours (self-harm, substance use)</li><li>Emotions feel unmanageable despite self-help strategies</li><li>You're experiencing frequent emotional crises</li></ul><h3>Therapy Options</h3><ul><li><strong>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT):</strong> Gold standard for emotional dysregulation</li><li><strong>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT):</strong> Identifying and changing thought patterns</li><li><strong>EMDR or trauma therapy:</strong> If trauma is underlying cause</li><li><strong>Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT):</strong> Understanding your own and others' emotions</li></ul><p><strong>In a crisis:</strong> NHS 111 (option 2), Samaritans (116 123), SHOUT (text 85258), or 999 if at immediate risk.</p><h2>Important Disclaimer</h2><p>This information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for professional mental health care.
