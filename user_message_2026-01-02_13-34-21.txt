Do  these"YOU ARE: ChatLLM Deep Agent operating as:
(1) Senior UK-based full-stack engineer (Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui),
(2) Evidence-focused neurodiversity researcher/editor (UK-first),
(3) Accessibility specialist (WCAG 2.2 AA),
(4) Product designer for a premium 2025 “ADHD Hub”.

ABSOLUTE HARD RULES
- You MUST complete PHASE 0 (AUDIT) then PHASE 1 (RESEARCH + EVIDENCE REGISTRY) BEFORE PHASE 2 (CODE/BUILD). Do not mix phases.
- Educational information only; not medical advice. No diagnosis. No medication dosing/switching. No “cure” claims.
- UK-first credibility: NHS + NICE NG87 + GOV.UK/Equality Act + SEND Code.
- Every non-trivial factual claim must be linked; PubMed items include PMID (and PMCID if available).
- Keep existing global header/footer/layout. DO NOT add a new global header/footer.

PROJECT CONTEXT
- Repo: neurobreath-platform (Next.js app in /web OR in nextjs_space; detect actual root and adapt paths accordingly)
- Goal: Upgrade the ADHD page into the go-to, credible, authentic, plausible, resource-rich ADHD hub:
  • UK-first but with US/EU tabs
  • Evidence-led (NHS/NICE + PubMed)
  • Practical management toolkits
  • Templates + exports
  • Gamification that is meaningful (not gimmicky)
  • Accessibility + performance + maintainability

REFERENCE ZIP (MANDATORY BLUEPRINT)
Use this uploaded zip as the UI/architecture template:
- Path: /mnt/data/Autism_Hub_Implementation_Plan (1).zip
You MUST study and reuse patterns from:
- components/autism/* (hero, country-switcher, how-to-use, evidence-hub, calm-toolkit-enhanced, skills-library-enhanced, daily-quests, weekly-chart, resources-library)
- app/api/pubmed/route.ts (E-utilities proxy)
- lib/progress-store-enhanced.ts + lib/data/*

IMPORTANT: Your prior work already added ADHD components and global CSS. You must now audit, fix, and restructure to meet a higher credibility bar.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
You MUST output:
1) PHASE 0 AUDIT REPORT (what exists, what changed, risks, fixes)
2) ADHD RESEARCH PACK (A–K structure below, with citations)
3) EVIDENCE REGISTRY + CONTENT DATASET files (TS preferred)
4) FILE TREE of all files touched/created (relative to repo root)
5) PATCH/DIFF for each file (unified diff)
6) RUN STEPS (commands + URLs)
7) QA / ACCEPTANCE TESTS checklist

========================================================
PHASE 0 — AUDIT (DELIVERABLE 1)
========================================================
Perform an audit of the existing ADHD implementation and produce an “AUDIT REPORT” with:

A) What files exist now (list):
- components/adhd/* and lib/data/adhd-*.ts (skills/quests/myths/templates)
- any modifications to app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx, globals.css
- any dependencies added (framer-motion, react-confetti)

B) Identify and fix these known quality/credibility risks:
1) Tailwind dynamic class strings like `bg-${color}-600` WILL NOT compile reliably without safelist.
   - Replace with a safe mapping object (explicit class strings) or use `cn()` with explicit variants.
2) Global CSS changes MUST NOT hijack the entire site:
   - Confetti canvas CSS (fixed position, z-index 9999) can break site overlays/modals.
   - Focus-visible rule must remain accessible but not override component styling unexpectedly.
   - ADHD color variables in :root are OK only if they do not conflict; otherwise scope them.
   ACTION: Move ADHD-only styling into:
   - a scoped CSS module, or
   - a wrapper class on /adhd route (e.g., `.adhd-scope`) and prefix ADHD-only rules.
3) “Evidence citations” currently include low-trust sources (e.g., magazines, influencers).
   - You may include community sources ONLY in a clearly labelled “Community & Lived Experience” section.
   - Main recommendations must be backed by NHS/NICE/CDC/AAP + PubMed.
4) “80% platform ADHD focus” changes to homepage/layout:
   - The primary requirement is an ADHD HUB page (one-stop shop).
   - If homepage was heavily altered, ensure other conditions hubs remain accessible.
   - If needed, revert homepage to neutral and route ADHD hub to /adhd with internal linking.
5) localStorage keys are inconsistent (adhd_quest_progress, adhd_pomodoro_stats, etc).
   - Standardise using namespaced keys: `nb:adhd:v2:*` and centralise via a progress store utility.

C) Produce a Fix Plan:
- What will be kept, refactored, moved, or removed.
- A “risk list” + how you will mitigate.

STOP after producing the AUDIT REPORT, then proceed to PHASE 1.

========================================================
PHASE 2 — BUILD “ONE-STOP ADHD HUB” PAGE (DELIVERABLES 4–7)
========================================================
PRIMARY OUTCOME
Upgrade the ADHD page into a structured hub that is the go-to ADHD resource. It must feel premium, credible, and practical.

ROUTING + STRUCTURE
- Implement /adhd route as the canonical hub (e.g., /app/adhd/page.tsx).
- If homepage was changed heavily, keep it neutral and link to /adhd prominently (do not destroy other hubs).

REQUIRED SECTIONS (ALL MUST EXIST)
1) HERO (UK-first, audience-aware)
- Audience switcher: Adult | Parent/Carer | Teacher/SENCO | Employer/Manager | Young Person
- Region switcher: UK | US | EU
- Persist in localStorage: nb:adhd:v2:prefs
- CTA buttons:
  • Start 2-minute Focus Sprint
  • Build Today’s Plan
  • Browse Skills
  • Download Templates
- Collapsible “How to use this hub” mini-tour

2) “PLAN IN 60 SECONDS” WIZARD (high-value)
Inputs: age band, setting, main challenge, available time (2/5/10/20 min), energy level (low/ok/high)
Outputs:
- 3 do-now actions (<5 min)
- 3 actions for this week
- 1 measurement suggestion
- 1 “if you get stuck” fallback
Save locally + print export

3) SKILLS LIBRARY (credible + searchable + filterable)
- Uses dataset (adhd-hub.ts)
- Each skill has:
  • step-by-step
  • pitfalls
  • age adaptations
  • evidence links (via registry)
  • “Log practice” (adds XP + minutes + streak)

4) QUESTS / CHALLENGES (meaningful gamification)
- Keep the existing Daily Quests concept, but:
  - Make it evidence-informed and not childish
  - Add “Personalised Quest Pack” based on chosen challenge (focus/time-blindness/etc)
  - Add “Weekly Review” (rule-based summary, not medical)

5) FOCUS TOOLKIT (ADHD-adapted)
- Keep Pomodoro but add:
  - “micro-sprint” (2/5/10 minutes)
  - “hyperfocus mode” (gentle reminders; no shame)
  - “distraction capture” mini notepad (external brain) saved locally
- Ensure notifications are optional and respectful

6) EMOTIONAL REGULATION + RSD SUPPORT (practical, careful)
- Add a small toolkit:
  - pause scripts
  - grounding + movement
  - “reframe checklist”
  - “communication scripts”
- Include clear disclaimer and evidence links where applicable

7) SLEEP & ROUTINES TOOLKIT (high demand)
- Add:
  - evening wind-down builder
  - morning launch checklist
  - “screens + sleep” short guide
- Cite NHS/NICE where appropriate

8) SCHOOL SUPPORT BUILDER (Teacher/Parent)
- Generate a checklist for:
  - classroom adjustments
  - exam/study supports
  - communication plan home-school
- Provide printable export

9) WORKPLACE ADJUSTMENTS BUILDER (Adult/Employer)
- Generate:
  - reasonable adjustments list (UK Equality Act framing)
  - scripts for requesting adjustments
  - “task clarity” agreement template
- Provide printable export

10) ASSESSMENT & APPOINTMENT PREP KIT (UK-first)
- “GP appointment prep” printable
- “symptom & impact tracker” (educational; no diagnosis)
- “questions to ask clinician” (non-medical, safe)

11) TEMPLATES & DOWNLOADS (must be genuinely useful)
Implement a “Template Generator” section that produces print-friendly pages (via /adhd/print route) for:
- Daily Plan
- Weekly Plan
- External Brain Capture Sheet
- School Support Checklist
- Workplace Adjustments Request (UK)
- Routine Builder (morning/evening)
- “Body Doubling Session Rules” card
Each template must cite appropriate guidance sources where needed and be clearly educational.

12) LATEST EVIDENCE (safe, curated + PubMed)
- UK curated links (NHS/NICE/SEND/Equality Act)
- PubMed tab:
  - via server route (E-utilities)
  - caching + basic rate limiting
  - show title/year/journal/PMID + link
- Add “Evidence level” labels:
  Guideline | Systematic review | Trial | Observational | Other

13) TRUST & SAFETY PANEL (credibility anchor)
- Prominent “Educational not medical advice”
- Crisis support block (UK + US)
- Privacy statement: local-only progress; no names/addresses/health records

PROGRESS + STORAGE STANDARDISATION (MUST DO)
- Replace ad hoc keys:
  - adhd_quest_progress, adhd_pomodoro_stats, adhd_practiced_skills
- With namespaced keys:
  - nb:adhd:v2:progress
  - nb:adhd:v2:prefs
  - nb:adhd:v2:logs
- Centralise in a progress-store file (reuse progress-store-enhanced pattern from zip) so UI updates in real time.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (PREMIUM + ACCESSIBLE)
- ADHD-friendly but not visually chaotic.
- Avoid overly aggressive animation; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Ensure color contrast passes WCAG.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works across tabs/dialogs.
- Avoid global CSS side effects; scope ADHD-only visuals.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- No heavy libraries loaded on every page. If confetti exists, lazy-load and only on ADHD route.
- Code-split large sections, keep initial load reasonable.
- No unbounded re-renders.

FINAL OUTPUTS (MANDATORY)
After implementing:
1) File tree
2) Unified diffs
3) Run steps:
   - yarn lint
   - yarn typecheck
   - yarn build
   - yarn dev + open /adhd
4) QA checklist with:
   - Accessibility checks (keyboard, headings, ARIA)
   - Preferences persistence checks
   - localStorage namespace checks
   - Print route checks
   - Evidence links checks
   - PubMed route rate-limit/caching checks
   - Lighthouse quick pass targets (best effort)

NOW START:
- FIRST: PHASE 0 audit report
- SECOND: PHASE 1 research pack + evidence registry + dataset
- THIRD: PHASE 2 code changes + diffs + run steps + QA checklist
