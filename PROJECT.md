# NeuroBreath.co.uk — Project Documentation

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025  
**Project Status:** Active Development  

---

## 🎯 Project Mission & Vision

NeuroBreath.co.uk is **the go-to, one-stop platform for neurodivergent support across the lifespan** — providing an integrated ecosystem of tools and learning that supports neurodivergent users (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia) and related wellbeing challenges (stress, low mood, emotional regulation difficulty), for children, teens, and adults.

### 🌟 North Star Definition

NeuroBreath becomes the default first platform people open when they want:
- A quick tool for calm/focus/sleep
- A structured practice plan
- A game or challenge that builds a real skill
- A clear dashboard showing improvement  
- Trusted guidance for parents/teachers/carers

---

## 🎯 Core Aims (One-Stop Shop Vision)

### 1. **Be the Go-To, One-Stop Platform for Neurodivergent Support**
Provide an integrated ecosystem of tools and learning that supports neurodivergent users (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia) and related wellbeing challenges (stress, low mood, emotional regulation difficulty), for children, teens, and adults.

### 2. **Deliver Practical Improvement Through Structured Routines**
Offer step-by-step resources, exercises, interactive tools, and training pathways that help users build calm, focus, emotional regulation, learning confidence, and daily functioning.

### 3. **Enable Measurable, Motivating Progress Without Shame**
Provide clear progress tracking, streaks, quests, rewards, and milestones that make improvement visible, encourage consistency, and make restarts easy and supportive.

### 4. **Support the Full Circle of Care**
Equip supporters (individuals, parents, teachers, carers, support workers) with practical toolkits, scripts, routines, classroom/home strategies, and progress summaries that help them support learners/clients effectively.

### 5. **Operate as a Trustworthy, Credible, Evidence-Informed Digital Product**
Maintain a clinically responsible tone, transparent sources where appropriate, strong accessibility and neuro-inclusive design, and clear safeguarding boundaries (supportive tools, not a substitute for professional care).

### 6. **Build a Scalable, High-Quality Web + Mobile Product Foundation**
Deliver a reliable, accessible platform on neurobreath.co.uk and the Flutter app, designed for growth into new modules, dashboards, partnerships, and premium resource packs.

## 📋 Specific Objectives (Measurable, Delivery-Ready)

### A) "One-Stop Shop" Structure and User Pathways

#### Launch a Guided "Start Here" System (Age + Goal + Preference)
- **Age modes:** Child / Teen / Adult
- **Goals:** Calm, Focus, Sleep, Emotional Regulation, Learning/Reading Support, Routine Support
- **Success measure:** A new user reaches a personalised plan within 3 clicks and starts a session within 60 seconds

#### Create Condition-Informed Hubs (Support-Focused, Non-Diagnostic)
- Hubs for Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Wellbeing & Mood Support (stress/low mood challenges)
- **Success measure:** Each hub contains: what helps, routines, tools, training, games, supporter guidance, signposting

### B) Evidence-Informed Credibility and Trust Framework

#### Build a "Trust & Evidence" Layer Across the Platform
- Clear tone guidelines (supportive, credible, non-claiming)
- Referencing model (sources where relevant; "why this helps" explanations)
- Safety boundaries and UK signposting (including crisis routes)
- **Success measure:** Every wellbeing/mental-health-related page includes appropriate disclaimers and signposting, and avoids clinical claims

#### Add "Quality Standards" for Content and Tools
- A checklist applied to every module: accessibility, clarity, age-appropriateness, low-overwhelm design, and measurable outcome
- **Success measure:** 100% of new modules pass the checklist before release

### C) Resources, Training, Practices, and Exercises

#### Publish a Modular Training Library (Micro-Lessons)
- Regulation skills (breathing, grounding, sensory breaks)
- ADHD supports (task start, planning, focus sprints)
- Dyslexia supports (phonics, blending, fluency routines)
- Emotional literacy (naming emotions, coping choices)
- **Success measure:** Each module includes: explain → practise → reflect → next step, and completes in 3–10 minutes

#### Offer Printable and Offline-Friendly Resources
- Quick cards, checklists, routines, classroom/home visuals, certificates
- **Success measure:** Downloads are one-click, A4 print-clean, and easy to find in each module

### D) Interactive Games, Challenges, Quests, Rewards

#### Deliver Interactive Games Tied to Real Skills
- Examples: focus sprint games, reading/phonics mini-games, memory sequencing, emotion coping scenarios
- **Success measure:** Each game clearly states "what this supports", has a 3–7 minute mode, and logs completion

#### Implement Quests and Challenge Tracks
- Examples: "7-Day Calm Starter", "14-Day Focus Builder", "10-Day Reading Confidence"
- **Success measure:** Each track includes daily steps, a progress bar, and a completion badge/certificate

#### Introduce Ethical Streaks + Rewards (Optional Toggles)
- Grace days and flexible targets (e.g., 3x/week option)
- No-shame restart flows
- Rewards: badges, coupons, unlockable content packs, certificates
- **Success measure:** Users can disable gamification; streak logic is consistent; restarts do not reset lifetime progress

### E) Measurable Progress Tracking and Dashboards

#### Build a Measurable Progress System Across All Tools
- Track: sessions completed, minutes practiced, streaks, quest completion, skill areas practiced, user ratings ("helpful/not helpful")
- **Success measure:** Dashboards update accurately and remain simple and readable

#### Create Supporter Dashboards (Optional)
- Parent/teacher/carer view: routines used, what worked, notes, printable summaries
- **Success measure:** Supporters can generate a simple weekly summary without complex setup

### F) Prompt Generation and AI Guidance (Guardrailed)

#### Launch a Prompt Generator for Each Context
- Parent scripts (calm, neutral language)
- Teacher strategies (classroom supports, attention breaks)
- Carer routines (handover notes, consistent plans)
- User self-coaching prompts (motivation, next-step clarity)
- **Success measure:** Outputs are short, editable, context-specific, and aligned to NeuroBreath tone

#### Deploy an "AI Coach" Feature with Safety Controls
- No diagnosis, no medication advice
- Clear boundaries + escalation signposting
- **Success measure:** Safe responses are consistent and the feature is clearly framed as supportive guidance

### G) Accessibility and Neuro-Inclusive Design Excellence

#### Meet High Accessibility and Neuro-Inclusive Standards
- Readable typography, reduced motion, sensory-friendly visuals
- Keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, simple UI
- **Success measure:** Core flows are fully usable with reduced motion enabled and with keyboard-only navigation

### H) Product Delivery, Platform Reliability, and Scale

#### Deliver a Stable Web + Flutter App Experience
- Shared components, tokens, performance standards, regression protection
- **Success measure:** Releases do not overwrite working legacy files; critical journeys are regression-tested

#### Enable Optional Login + Privacy-First Guest Mode
- Guest mode provides full core value; login enables sync and dashboards
- **Success measure:** Guest mode works end-to-end; accounts add sync without friction

#### Implement UK GDPR-Ready Privacy Foundations
- Data minimisation, transparency, deletion/export pathway
- **Success measure:** Users can control their data and understand what is stored and why
