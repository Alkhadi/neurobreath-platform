ROLE & OUTPUT CONTRACT (Cursor IDE)
You are operating inside Cursor IDE as:
1) a senior UK-based full-stack engineer (Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui),
2) an accessibility specialist (WCAG-first),
3) a neurodiversity researcher/editor (NHS/NICE-first + PubMed evidence).

You MUST output:
1) A FILE TREE of every file you will touch/create (relative to /web repo root)
2) A PATCH/DIFF for each file (unified diff format)
3) RUN STEPS (commands to run + what URL to open)
4) QA / ACCEPTANCE TESTS checklist

PROJECT CONTEXT
Repo: neurobreath-platform
Target: /web (Next.js app)

PRIMARY GOAL
Professionally rebuild the Autism page into a one-stop “Autism Hub” (UK/US/EU) for:
- Teachers / SENCO / TAs
- Parents & carers
- Autistic children/teens/adults
- Employers/workplaces (reasonable adjustments + inclusion basics)
All inside ONE page using an Audience switcher + Country switcher.

INPUTS YOU MUST INTEGRATE
A) Existing Autism page content currently live in the repo (find it by searching for:
   "Autism Support for Teachers" OR "Legacy: autism.html" OR the headings in the user-provided content).
   Keep intent but restructure the entire body for modern 2025 UI/UX.

B) ZIPPED FILE CONTENT (must be integrated):
   The user provided autism-research-2026.zip which contains Untitleddocument.html.
   Import that file into the repo (e.g. /web/content/autism/Untitleddocument.html OR convert to MD/MDX/data).
   Extract the best content blocks from it (do NOT carry over Google Docs inline CSS).
   Treat it as a long-form draft that must be verified/cited and adapted into structured modules.

C) Blog evidence base integration:
   Pull/reflect any autism evidence and “how to manage autism” guidance patterns already used on the Blog/AI Hub page:
   - same tone, safety disclaimers, and citation style
   - reuse any existing “Ask the AI Coach” widget patterns and PubMed server proxy patterns if they exist

NON-NEGOTIABLE EVIDENCE RULES
1) NHS/NICE and major public guidance FIRST for UK claims (NICE CG170/CG128/CG142; SEND Code; GOV.UK PINS; EEF SEND guidance; AET).
2) PubMed for intervention evidence; show PubMed IDs and link to PubMed/PMC.
3) For US include CDC prevalence pages and Autism Society resources.
4) For EU include Autism-Europe + EASNIE resources.
5) Every non-trivial factual claim must be citable (linkable). If evidence is mixed/uncertain, say so.
6) Add a “Myths & facts” micro-section that clearly states vaccines do NOT cause autism and points to CDC/NHS-quality sources (short, not political).

SAFETY + SCOPE
- Educational information only; NOT medical advice; no diagnosis.
- Prominent crisis support module (UK: NHS 111 option 2 + Samaritans; US: 988; include “if immediate danger call emergency services”).
- No personal data collection. Local-only progress tracking for now.
- Respect autistic identity: strengths-based, non-stigmatizing language.

TECH CONSTRAINTS
- Keep the site’s existing header/footer and layout; DO NOT introduce a new global header/footer.
- Use existing design system + global tokens already in the project.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigable, correct headings, ARIA for tabs/accordions, reduced motion support, color contrast.
- Performance: code-split heavy modules; avoid huge client bundles; only fetch PubMed on demand with caching.
- “Local only with intention to upgrade”: implement a storage abstraction so future sync can be added later.

WHAT TO BUILD (PAGE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE)
Rebuild the Autism page body into these modern sections:

1) HERO (audience-aware)
- Title changes based on audience selection:
  Teachers / Parents & carers / Autistic people / Employers
- Quick CTAs:
  “Start today’s 3-minute calm”
  “Start a quick plan”
  “Browse strategies”
  “Download toolkit PDF”
- Add a small “How to use this page” collapsible mini-tour.

2) AUDIENCE SWITCHER + COUNTRY SWITCHER (sticky)
- Audience: Teacher | Parent/Carer | Autistic Person | Employer
- Country: UK | US | EU
- The page content blocks, resources and crisis info update based on these settings.
- Store selections in localStorage.

3) TODAY’S PLAN (genius 2025 feature)
A guided wizard that generates a practical plan based on:
- age band (early years / primary / secondary / adult)
- main need right now (transitions / sensory / communication / anxiety / sleep / school refusal / workplace stress)
- setting (home / classroom / community / workplace)
Outputs:
- 3 “Do now” actions (under 5 minutes)
- 3 “Build this week” actions
- 1 measurement suggestion (simple progress marker)
- Buttons: “Add to Focus Garden”, “Save”, “Export PDF”

4) SKILLS LIBRARY (tagged, searchable)
A card grid with filters and search:
- Tags: routines, transitions, visual supports, communication (AAC/PECS/Makaton), sensory, social, anxiety, sleep, school, workplace
Each skill card includes:
- Why it helps (1–2 lines)
- How to do it (steps)
- Common pitfalls + adaptations by age
- Evidence links (NHS/NICE + PubMed where relevant)
- “Log practice” button (adds to stats + streak + rewards)

5) GAMES / CHALLENGES / QUESTS (gamified, practical)
Add genuinely useful, credible micro-interactives (NOT childish UI):
- “Now/Next Builder” (create a Now/Next board and print/download)
- “Transition Timer Script” (choose phrasing + timer length; generates a short script)
- “Sensory Detective” (quick checklist; outputs a sensory plan and “calm corner” items)
- “Communication Choice Challenge” (model AAC/PECS options; “offer two choices” script)
- “Emotion Thermometer” + “Coping Menu” builder
- “Workplace Adjustments Generator” (for Employer + Adult audience; outputs reasonable adjustments list)
Each interactive should:
- Save locally
- Award XP/badges
- Provide a “share/print” option (PDF)

6) CALM & CO-REGULATION TOOLKIT
Keep your breathing tools but upgrade the module:
- Box breathing, coherent 5–5, SOS 60s, and a no-hold option for people who dislike breath holds
- Add 2–3 “calming techniques” beyond breathing (grounding, sensory reset, movement break, scripting)
- Provide age adaptations + “stop if dizzy/uncomfortable” warnings.
- One-tap “Log a calm minute” button that updates streak + charts instantly.

7) REAL-TIME PROGRESS (local-only)
Replace the current basic stats with a richer dashboard:
- Streak, sessions, minutes, “skills practiced”, “plans completed”
- Weekly view (mini chart)
- Badges:
  - First Calm Minute
  - 3-day streak
  - Visual Supports Starter
  - Transition Pro
  - Sensory Planner
  - Communication Supporter
  - Inclusive Classroom Builder
  - Workplace Ally
- “Reset stats for this page only” remains.

Implementation:
- localStorage keys namespaced (e.g., nb:autism:v2:progress)
- A small state/store hook so UI updates immediately (no refresh).

8) LATEST EVIDENCE (live, safe)
Add an “Evidence Updates” module:
- UK tab: NICE + NHS + GOV.UK PINS + SEND Code + EEF + AET (curated links)
- PubMed tab: fetch latest relevant articles via server route (E-utilities) with:
  - query presets (visual supports, PECS/AAC, peer-mediated, anxiety CBT adapted, inclusive schooling)
  - show title, journal, year, PMID, short snippet
  - caching and rate-limiting
No scraping. No exposing keys.

9) PATHWAYS & SUPPORT (UK/US/EU)
Audience-aware guidance:
- UK: SEND/EHCP overview, school adjustments, signposting (NAS/AET) + “how to prepare for appointments”
- US: IEP/504 basics and national resources
- EU: Autism-Europe + inclusive education resources
Keep this practical and short, with “Downloadable checklists”.

10) DOWNLOADABLES (PDF GENERATORS)
Generate toolkits on demand (client-side or server route):
- One-page profile template
- Visual schedule templates (Now/Next + daily timetable)
- Calm plan card (what helps / what to avoid / early signs / recovery steps)
- School-home communication sheet
- Workplace adjustments sheet
Allow users to choose audience + country + age band and export PDF.

11) INTERNAL LINKS TO OTHER NEUROBREATH PAGES
Add a “Related tools” strip that links to existing pages (detect actual routes in repo):
- Blog/AI Hub (Ask the AI Coach)
- Focus Garden
- Breathing technique pages (box / 4-7-8 / coherent / SOS)
- Dyslexia reading training page (for comorbidity navigation)
Only link to routes that exist; do not create broken links.

RESEARCH & CITATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
- Build a “References” section with grouped citations:
  NICE (CG170/CG128/CG142), GOV.UK PINS, SEND Code, EEF SEND guidance, AET resources,
  CDC autism data pages, Autism-Europe, EASNIE, and selected PubMed PMIDs.
- Any prevalence stats must be sourced (UK: NHS/NAS; US: CDC).
- Do not invent statistics. If you can’t verify, remove it.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS YOU MUST FOLLOW
1) Locate the current Autism page file(s) and components with ripgrep.
2) Import Untitleddocument.html from the zip into /web/content/autism/ and parse/extract content into structured data (TS/JSON/MDX).
3) Rebuild page as modular components under /web/components/autism/ (or similar).
4) Add local progress store + hooks under /web/lib/ or /web/hooks/.
5) Add/Reuse server route for PubMed E-utilities (prefer reuse from Blog AI Hub if already implemented).
6) Add PDF generation (toolkit export) with minimal dependencies.
7) Ensure a11y + responsive.
